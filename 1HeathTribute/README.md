## A Tribute to Heath Ledger
built with html and css

## About
On January 22, 2008, the world lost an amazing talent. 
Heath Ledger portrayed a multitude of different characters and never allowed himself to be typecasted.
He acted as romantic hero, psychotic villian, high school hearthrob, oppressed cowboy, drug addict... the list goes on.
I'm inspired by Heath's determination to learn and grow as a versatile actor and dedicate my first step into web design to him. 

"Some people find their shtick," Ledger reflected on the categorization of style. 
"I never figured out who 'Heath Ledger' is on film: 'This is what you expect when you hire me, and it will be recognizable'... 
People always feel compelled to sum you up, to presume that they have you and can describe you. That's fine. 
But there are so many stories inside of me and a lot I want to achieve outside of one flat note."
