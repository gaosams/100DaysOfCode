# 100 Days Of Code - Sam's Log

<br>
## Day 5: August 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Experimenting with CSS3.

**Thoughts:** Overwhelmed by the amount of properties out there that can be used to style html. Learning a bit of background as to why certain piece of code look a certain way... like why -ms- and -webkit- both need to be specified to cover a majority of browsers.

## Day 4: August 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Messing with layout more. Learned about media queries. Decided to go simple with tribute page layout.

**Thoughts:** Difficult to get started coding today. Didn't start til around 11pm. It's challenging keeping code neat and tidy when messing around with different things. It was hard keeping track of what tag or class needed margins or padding changed. I'm not a fan of bootstrap's fixed padding for its columns. Added a To-Do list to the bottom of the tribute page. I will complete this tomorrow :D

## Day 3: August 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Began coding tribute page for Heath Ledger. Messed around with different formatting. 

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time getting sucked into the interesting life of Heath Ledger instead of coding today. First time using hte bootstrap grid system, and it is super useful. I've looked at source code in the past and didn't understand why there were so many div's and whatnot but it makes sense now. Hopefully will finish the tribute page tomorrow or the day after and start working on my portfolio page.

## Day 2: July 31, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Read up on bootstrap, jQuery, and some css libraries. Finished jQuery exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Signed up for a CodePen account!

**Thoughts:** Difficult to start coding today with the number of things I wanted to look up. Learned that uncompressed files are good during development/debugging, compressed file good for production: saves bandwidth and improves performance. I included the link to a bootstrap article I found that was pretty helpful~ Though, I learned some jQuery functions, I'm left wondering of effective use cases for most of these... I'll look up more about jQuery soon to see how you might integrate them with user interactions. I'll be starting a project tomorrow! HORRAY! (might postpone to learn more about github)

## Day 1: July 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the Responsive Design with Bootstrap exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Started keeping a Github log!

**Thoughts:** I learned a bit about Bootstrap today. I still dont understand how to use the files downloaded from Bootstrap. Will need to figure that out later. Biggest takeaway seems to be the grid system. Will read more on it before starting jQuery.

## Day 0: July 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the HTML/CSS exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Finished reading A Book Apart: HTML5 for Web Designers 

**Thoughts:** Picking up little tid bits about HTML/CSS that I didn't know about. Good review of html/css content on the first day. Feeling pretty productive and cant wait to start on Responsive Design with Bootstrap tomorrow. Woot! Stoked because I know nothing about Bootstrap aside from comments people have made in passing.
