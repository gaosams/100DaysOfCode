# 100 Days Of Code - Sam's Log



<br>
## Day 35: September 3, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: finish quote machine. made twitter button functional and fixed start load. 

**Thoughts:** I've been keeping a calendar with randomly assigned due dates for projects. I'm quite proud of myself for finishing this project on time though I hope to go back and personalize it... maybe add a loading animation. (Woohoo!) I'll be preparing for interview and fall job fair season by creating a page template for projects on my portfolio site. Looking back at the quote machine project, the biggest hurdles came with API's themselves not working out. I am still not happy with the amount I understand about ajax and get requests. I feel like many of the APIs I tried should have worked but maybe my code was missing something...hmm... Hopefully I can sort out more questions and have more practice with this material in the next few projects.

## Day 34: September 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: generate random color to fade into when making new quote in random quote machine.

**Thoughts:** Cleaned up some code. I may have developed some bad habits with making classes. I usually go back to consolidate classes which is pretty time consuming and stressful when things dont quite work sometimes. Using bootstrap css styling is difficult to override sometimes so it seems easier to make my own styles. Styling in general is a little easier :)

## Day 33: September 1, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: learned how to use api's on mashape. linked button click to generating new quote

**Thoughts:**  spent a decent amount of time googling how to do things but honestly caved and started looking at other people's code to see how they approached api's. I didn't understand a lot the ways people were connecting with data :/ Lots of obscure code i'd never seen. Saw a few examples of people using mashape which i'd looked into but couldnt get to work a couple days ago. I was missing the header code. Once I got an api working, the rest seems fun... Though connecting to social media might be the next hurdle D:

## Day 32: August 31, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Github personal page. Fix portfolio page.

**Thoughts:**  The headings for each input field in the contact section wasn't appearing when typing. Changed the position to relative instead of absolute. Solved the issue! Pretty excited about being able to find issues in code and fixing them. I'll need to remind myself to always check the whole page after making major adjustments to be sure everything is still functioning. I set up a github personal page with jekyll. It's pretty exciting! I've set a goal to finish making a page template by Sunday. Also learned about Markdown! (the notation that github uses! super useful shorthand)

## Day 31: August 30, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: N/a

**Thoughts:**  Chatted with a company today and feeling ridiculously nervous :'( I'm so sad that I have not kept up with coding. It dawned on me that job fair season is creepin' up hard. I'm going to push to get the quote machine done but also a full functional portfolio site hosted on github based off of my portfolio page on codepen.

## Day 30: August 29, Monday

**Today's Progress**: More ajax and random quote machine.

**Thoughts:**  Struggling lots with ajax and how to work with different API's. It's incredibly frustrating working with this stuff. Most helpful resource for understanding how to get and use data from other sources around the web has been youtube videos. These small details are so incredibly helpful in working with data... like how to open the Chrome DevTools Console panel and find a website's api or check to see if an api you are trying to use is being read by the browser.

## Day 28: August 26, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Back to coding! ajax struggles

**Thoughts:** Spent the day being incredibly frustrated at ajax and the random quote machine project. Most of the frustration came with not knowing how to debug. After a few hours of reading documentation and trying to understand what to do, I found a video that showed me how to check if the GET request was even getting through. Good stuff. Still trying to understand the difference between .getJSON and .ajax. Also wrote up a little bit of css for the random quote machine.

## Day 27: August 25, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: No Code. Tornado. No Power

**Thoughts:** Day after a handful of tornadoes ripped through town. No fatalities but many houses, trees, and businesses got wrecked. Hopefully the power will be back up tomorrow.

## Day 25: August 23, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More Algorithms. Roman Numeral Converter, Where art Thou, Search and Replace, Pig Latin, DNA Pairing.

**Thoughts:** Got hung up on a roman numeral conversion algorithm thinking that I could make something that would generate the numerals but I ended up making a an array with all the possible roman numerals for: ones, tens, hundreds, thousands digits.

<br>
## Day 24: August 22, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started uploading images to cloudinary to use on codePen. Uploaded portfolio page to codepen and editing code based on codepen analysis.

**Thoughts:** A few style issues. Learned more about specificity in css. Seems to be frowned upon to use !important and using id's as selectors. Hmm... there's an ongoing discussion on these topics. Personally seems useful and increases code legibility when using id's as selectors. Alas!

<br>
## Day 23: August 21, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Solved algorithm that takes in two arrays and returns single array with all unique items between the two. Finished Portfolio Page (ish)

**Thoughts:** Solved the algorithm pretty quickly but I'd used filter inside a for loop. Good thing there was a warning saying it was non-optimal! I reworked the algorithm twice. Once filtering twice to get unique items for each and then combining them. The final time, I only used one filter function. This algorithm was good practice for understanding how to use filter in lieu of a for loop :) 

Finished first draft of the portfolio page. I will continue editing it in the future but for now, it's pretty good! I learned a bunch while coding this portfolio page in the past 2 weeks or so. I became more familiar with some of the bootstrap defaults, used javascript for the first time in a web page, and messed around with css and javascript animations. It was fun working with scroll animations, tedius working with hover colors and spacing, and very rewarding to see a decently nice page come together. (will upload onto codepen tomorrow)

<br>
## Day 22: August 20, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Reading up on how to use API and using codeacademy.

**Thoughts:** Lots of online resources. Codeacademy is informative when stuck on topics. There's a lot of explanation which is nice. Free code camp does a good job pacing you through content in a hands on way though. Still a bit stuck on how to work with APIs... Chrome browser says this: "XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience" ...so it seems that codeacademy's content is a little bit outdated? Lots of confusion surrounding all this.

<br>
## Day 21: August 19, Friday

**Today's Progress**: started random quote machine. started intermediate algorithm scripting.

**Thoughts:** some scripting methods seems more complicated to set up and use than just using a for loop. Started looping for api's of fun quotes to generate. Will be the first time I link api with code. exciting.

<br>
## Day 20: August 18, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Adjusted start screen to take up the whole page. Navigation bar appears after scrolling down. Added a non-functional scroll-to-top button in the bottom right corner. Also did a few exercises on JSON, API on FCC. Also found why the hamburger menu wasn't working! I'd forgotten to put in the bootstrap javascript. silly me. 

**Thoughts:** There's many different ways to animate objects. Still figuring out which way is best to use or most versatile. I find myself typing up janky code and needing to clean it up so it is robust and reusable for different elements. It's a little frustrating and daunting but I'm definitely getting in a lot of practice and learning lots.

<br>
## Day 19: August 17, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Contact Form on Portfolio Page.

**Thoughts:** Got stumped trying to work with php but decided that would be a challenge for another day. I styled the contact form on my portfolio page and I'm pretty happy with it! I got a change to work more with css transitions and javascript. I'm getting used to manipulating css with javascript/jquery. 

**Link to work:** [Portfolio Page](/portfolioPage)



<br>
## Day 18: August 16, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: finished object oriented and functional programming exercises on FCC. 

**Thoughts:** Learned about storing functions within an object if you need/want to manipulate a private variable. (ie. the 'speed' of a Car object. Also some practice with other methods such as filter and reduce! Would have been useful to try this exercise before solving the algorithm a few days ago, but I definitely feel like i learned more struggling through methods than learning them first. It makes sense that you would keep functions internal to manipulate private variables when look at objects.

<br>
## Day 17: August 15, Monday

**Today's Progress**: differentiating push and concat. Sorting and characterCodes. Finished Basic Algorithm section of FCC. 

**Thoughts:** Sorting is super useful in javascript horray! I ran into issues with the push method for a while because it returns the new array's length as opposed to what the new array is. The original array transforms! With these algorithms, I feel the longest amount of time is figuring out syntax as opposed to thinking through the logic. Though sometimes the logic is an interesting challenge. Definitely made the last algorithm (Caesars Cipher) more difficult than it needed to be. Thought i needed to use % but everything was possible with simple addition and subtraction! :D Excited to start coding intermediate algorithm scripts eventually. I still need to catch up on Object Oriented and Functional Programming exercises on FCC and continue working on the Portfolio Page. After those two I'll tackle the JSON APIs and Ajax exercises on FCC. Sweet. All foreign terminology. 

Reflecting on the third week into #100DaysOfCode... definitely feel a bit burnt out from coding. It's often the last thing I tackle for the day. If I work on the Portfolio Page, I usually want to set aside a large portion of time to noodle through completing something on the page, which I haven't had these last few days. It takes a bit to get into the mindset of thinking and reading documentation for long periods of time.

## Day 16: August 14, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More practice with javascript objects. More algorithm scripting with the Filter javascript method.

**Thoughts:** Interesting how the filter method doesn't feed all variables into an external function. In the Seek and Destroy algorithm on FCC, I realized there was a difference between:

1.) return arr.filter(seek()); with the seek() function outside of the main function

2.) arr.filter(function seek(val) { insert code...});

In version 1, I couldn't use variables i'd defined in the main function... but in version 2 i could. Interesting... It makes sense but why not allow the function inside a filter to take arguments? Maybe there aren't any cases you'd be using the same filter function in multiple filters? hmmmmmm

<br>
## Day 15: August 13, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Worked on website. Added navigation bar highlighting upon scrolling and smooth scrolling animation. Tried finding why hamburger menu doesn't work. 

**Thoughts:** It's pretty difficult making a few things happen without running into other small fixes in code. I added smooth scrolling javascript and then a bug appeared where elements in focus stayed highlighted so i needed to adjust the css for that. I used !important to override certain css but then it seems that if you include an id and class (example: #myNavbar .navbarText), it will override other classes. Awesome.

<br>
## Day 14: August 12, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More algorithm practice. Added javascript and jQuery to portfolio page. Adjusted navigation hover colors. The navigation doesn’t expand when clicking on  hamburger. need to fix this bug...

**Thoughts:** New function str.indexOf() is pretty useful. I wonder if it has the same run time as a for loop since it checks if a certain string is in another string. On the portfolio page, I added the jQuery library. It's my first time linking javascript with html and css. It's difficult to get used to calling elements from your html file and manipulating them with conditionals... things like: make the navigation disappear when the scroll position hits 300 (or something more specifically tied to a page element).

## Day 13: August 11, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: A few algorithms

**Thoughts:**  Unfortunately didn't get around to coding more than a few algorithms on freeCodeCamp for an hour today. Some of these are incredibly short. I always have to code on a local text editor so I can debug or remember what certain methods will do... Will hopefully pick up again tomorrow.

## Day 12: August 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Started and completed basic structure for portfolio page. Completed 3 basic algorithms. Debugging javascript in chrome!

**Thoughts:**  I had difficulties remembering how to make a navigation bar. There's a lot of classes to remember especially with a collapsing hamburger menu. Also had a difficult time with footer logos that linked to other social media. If not in a div the icons would display an underscore when highlighting. I still dont know why this happens but settled with putting the icons in separate divs with inline-block display so they show up on the same row. The algorithms are still relatively simple to solve at this point. Tomorrow I hope to figure out contact form, navigation highlighting based on scroll location, and animating the hamburger menu!

<br>
## Day 11: August 9, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Regular Expressions. Completed palindromes using regular expressions! Lots of other basic algorithms scripting. Made a forum post on FCC.

**Thoughts:**  Regular expressions are super useful! Pretty confusing stuff. When do you use /\d/ as opposed to /\d+/? I'll be looking into the syntax tomorrow! Algorithms are super fun. I just rediscovered that the forum exists to share projects for feedback so I posted a link to my tribute page for feedback. awesome. Hoping to start on portfolio page coding and playing around with using chrome to test javascript code.

## Day 10: August 8, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Switch Statements and Objects in javascript.

**Thoughts:** Got stuck on syntax for basic algorithm to check for palindrome. When googling, there was i, g and other notation i didn't understand so I tried to storm through FCC lessons today to learn more syntax. Difficult to remember the different ways of accessing object properties! I'll have to practice more to get the hang of it. Seems like you have to use bracket notation if you are accessing the object property through another variable, and you cannot print something like: testObj["an entree"] without assigning it to a variable and printing the variable.

## Day 9: August 7, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More javascript basics and algorithm basics. 

**Thoughts:** Reintroduced to functions, booleans, conditionals, and comparisons; Had a busy day purging my closet instead of coding. Will catch up tomorrow.

## Day 8: August 6, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Learning javascript basics and setting up javascript coding environment on computer. 

**Thoughts:** Mostly relearning some coding and differences in syntax on FCC. Combing through the basic javascript portion of FCC and started the basic algorithm scripting section. Takes a while to get through the content but I need to remember that these baby steps will build up a nice foundation for projects in the future. I plan to start the portfolio project on FCC either tomorrow or the day after! I asked a friend about node.js and got some resources to look into. I'll be experimenting with chrome inspector and whatnot. It feels good to be confused about content. It means more learning :)

## Day 7: August 5, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finish Tribute Page

**Thoughts:** Messed around with adding filmography that would collapse well in mobile and centered between year and movie title. Rows and columns are incredibly useful but I wondering if there is a better way that doesn't require so many divs.

<br>
## Day 6: August 4, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Experimenting with CSS transitions. Learned about vendor prefixes 

**Thoughts:** Difficult mixing classes when you want to have multiple animations. Say you have a bunch of buttons that all fade but all change border radius at different rates upon hovering. It doesn't seem like you can separate both of these into a fade-transition class and border-radius-transition class. Calls for a lot of code copy/paste. Hmm. Might look into it more tomorrow. Super stoked at how simple it is to make something as fun as a button that goes from rectangle to oval when hovering!

<br>
## Day 5: August 3, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Experimenting with CSS3.

**Thoughts:** Overwhelmed by the amount of properties out there that can be used to style html. Learning a bit of background as to why certain piece of code look a certain way... like why -ms- and -webkit- both need to be specified to cover a majority of browsers.

<br>
## Day 4: August 2, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Messing with layout more. Learned about media queries. Decided to go simple with tribute page layout.

**Thoughts:** Difficult to get started coding today. Didn't start til around 11pm. It's challenging keeping code neat and tidy when messing around with different things. It was hard keeping track of what tag or class needed margins or padding changed. I'm not a fan of bootstrap's fixed padding for its columns. Added a To-Do list to the bottom of the tribute page. I will complete this tomorrow :D

## Day 3: August 1, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Began coding tribute page for Heath Ledger. Messed around with different formatting. 

**Thoughts:** Spent a lot of time getting sucked into the interesting life of Heath Ledger instead of coding today. First time using hte bootstrap grid system, and it is super useful. I've looked at source code in the past and didn't understand why there were so many div's and whatnot but it makes sense now. Hopefully will finish the tribute page tomorrow or the day after and start working on my portfolio page.

## Day 2: July 31, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Read up on bootstrap, jQuery, and some css libraries. Finished jQuery exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Signed up for a CodePen account!

**Thoughts:** Difficult to start coding today with the number of things I wanted to look up. Learned that uncompressed files are good during development/debugging, compressed file good for production: saves bandwidth and improves performance. I included the link to a bootstrap article I found that was pretty helpful~ Though, I learned some jQuery functions, I'm left wondering of effective use cases for most of these... I'll look up more about jQuery soon to see how you might integrate them with user interactions. I'll be starting a project tomorrow! HORRAY! (might postpone to learn more about github)

## Day 1: July 30, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the Responsive Design with Bootstrap exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Started keeping a Github log!

**Thoughts:** I learned a bit about Bootstrap today. I still dont understand how to use the files downloaded from Bootstrap. Will need to figure that out later. Biggest takeaway seems to be the grid system. Will read more on it before starting jQuery.

## Day 0: July 29, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished all of the HTML/CSS exercises on FreeCodeCamp. Finished reading A Book Apart: HTML5 for Web Designers 

**Thoughts:** Picking up little tid bits about HTML/CSS that I didn't know about. Good review of html/css content on the first day. Feeling pretty productive and cant wait to start on Responsive Design with Bootstrap tomorrow. Woot! Stoked because I know nothing about Bootstrap aside from comments people have made in passing.
